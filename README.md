# The code is written in c.
-->The code written implements Red-Black tree insertion and deletion as required by the user
along with many other operations.
Instructions as to how to access the code appear when the code is run. The user can insert 
multiple elements time and again into the tree until he wishes to exit the code. However,
deletion occurs only one element at a time. The user can enter the Display operation to view
all the nodes of the Red-Black tree with their color and their parent node. Also, to avoid 
repetitions, frequency option has been added which shows how many times a particular element 
has been added.
The user can find out the minimum valued element, can search for any particular element, and
if found can view all its properties, as well as find out the black-height of any particular node.
